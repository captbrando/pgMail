Welcome!  This README will be short and sweet so you can get to 
coding!

Essentially, pgMail is simply a stored function written in TCL
which takes 4 arguments of type 'text' (Who is it from, who is it 
to, subject, and body of message), contacts the email server via 
TCL sockets, and transmits your email (Now UTF-8 Compatible!).  

Before you can use pgMail, you must install the TCL/u procedural
language.  TCL/u is an UNRESTRICTED version of TCL that the
database may use in its stored functions.  ** Take into account
that you must prepare adequate security precautions when adding 
the TCL/u language to your database! **  The author will not be
responsible for misconfigured servers allowing dangerous users
to do bad things.

To install the TCL/u procedural language, you must have compiled
and installed the TCL extensions of PostgreSQL (or in the binary
versions, just make sure you install the TCL RPM).  Once you 
are sure this has been completed, simply type the following at
the unix shell prompt as a database administrator.

# createlang pltclu <database>

In the place of <database>, put the name of your database that 
you will be adding the stored procedure to.  If you want it to
also be added to all new databases, use "template1" as your 
database name.

*** BEFORE ADDING THE PROCEDURE TO YOUR DATABASE YOU MUST DO THE ***
*** FOLLOWING!!!                                                 ***

Replace the text <ENTER YOUR MAILSERVER HERE> with the fully
qualified domain name for your mailserver.  i.e., mail.server.com.

Replace the text <ENTER YOUR DATABASESERVER HERE> with the fully
qualified domain name for your database server.  i.e., db.server.com.

*** NOW ON TO LESS DRAMATIC TEXT! ***

Once you have completed this step, use the psql interface to 
add the pgMail function.  Just copy the contents of the 
pgmail.sql file and paste it into your window.  You may also
load it directly from the command line by typing 

# psql -e [database] < pgmail.sql

Once you have installed the stored function, simply call the 
procedure as follows.

select pgmail('Send From <from@from.com>','Send To <to@to.com>',
 'Subject goes here','Plaintext message body here.');

select pgmail('Send From <from@from.com>','Send To <to@to.com>',
 'Subject goes here','','HTML message body here.');

Or now, multipart MIME!

select pgmail('Send From <from@from.com>','Send To <to@to.com>',
 'Subject goes here','Plaintext message body here.', 'HTML message body here.');

In both the Send From and Send To fields, you may include either
only the email, or the email enclosed in <> with a plaintext name.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing your install.

There are some examples to try which have been included.  You 
MUST FIRST replace the string <YOUREMAIL> in the 
example.execute.sql script with your real email address, and
install the plpgsql language just like you did the pltclu above.
You can do that by entering a "createlang [YOUR DATABASE] plpgsql".  

Once that is complete, execute the example.setup.sql.  Then
execute the example.execute.sql script.  You will see 2 emails 
in your mailbox.  To remove this example, execute the 
example.cleanup.sql script.
